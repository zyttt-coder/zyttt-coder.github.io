I am currently a Master's student in the [**Artificial Intelligence**](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/pg/mcomp-ai/) program at the [**NUS School of Computing**](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), and an intern at the [**NExT++**](https://www.nextcenter.org/) lab, which is led by [**Prof. Tat-Seng Chua**](https://www.chuatatseng.com/).  

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** from the [**CUHK(SZ) School of Data Science**](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en). My research interests include **Natural Language Processing**, **LLM Alignment**, and **Reinforcement Learning**. You can find my CV [**here**]().
